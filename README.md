# CustomErrorPage

This is a simple Umbraco 10 solution for testing custom error page configuration.
On Windows open subfolder *CustomErrorPage* in Explorer and open a terminal (PowerShell).

Execute:

```bash
dotnet run
```

This should result in some success messages with links to the local webserver.
Click on http://localhost:13660 (you might see a link with a different port number).

Follow the instructions in the browser.
